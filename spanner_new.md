This command will display a list of enabled services in your project, including [spanner.googleapis.com](http://spanner.googleapis.com).





To deploy a Google Cloud Spanner instance using Terraform, you'll need to have Terraform installed and configured with Google Cloud credentials. Here are the steps to deploy a Cloud Spanner instance using Terraform:

Install Terraform: If you haven't already, install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from the official Terraform website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Set Up Google Cloud Credentials: Make sure you have Google Cloud credentials set up on your local machine. You can do this by installing the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) and running gcloud auth application-default login to authenticate.

Create a Terraform Configuration File: Create a .tf file (e.g., [spanner.tf](http://spanner.tf)) to define your Terraform configuration for the Cloud Spanner instance. Here's a basic example:

hcl
Copy code
provider "google" {
credentials = file("path/to/your/credentials.json")
project     = "your-gcp-project-id"
region      = "us-central1"  # Choose your desired region
}

resource "google_spanner_instance" "example_instance" {
name     = "my-spanner-instance"
config   = "regional-us-central1"
node_count = 1  # Set the desired number of nodes
}
Replace "path/to/your/credentials.json" with the path to your Google Cloud service account key JSON file. Modify the project ID, region, instance name, and node count as needed.

Initialize Terraform: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Terraform configuration file. Run the following command to initialize Terraform and download the necessary provider plugins:
bash
Copy code
terraform init
Plan and Apply: After initialization, you can preview the changes Terraform will make by running:
bash
Copy code
terraform plan
This command will show you a summary of what Terraform plans to create or modify.

If the plan looks correct, apply the changes by running:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type "yes" to proceed.

Verify Deployment: After the apply command completes successfully, your Cloud Spanner instance should be deployed. You can verify this by logging in to the Google Cloud Console and navigating to the "Spanner" section.

Destroy Resources (Optional): If you ever need to tear down the Cloud Spanner instance, you can do so with Terraform by running:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the destruction of resources. Be cautious, as this will delete the Cloud Spanner instance and its data.

Remember that this is a basic Terraform configuration for creating a Cloud Spanner instance. Depending on your requirements, you may want to configure additional settings such as database creation, access control, and more in your Terraform configuration file.

Create a .tf file (e.g., [spanner.tf](http://spanner.tf)) to define your Spanner instance and database configuration. Here's an example configuration:

hcl
Copy code
provider "google" {
credentials = file(var.credentials_file)
project     = var.project_id
region      = "us-central1"
}

resource "google_spanner_instance" "example" {
name             = "example-instance"
config           = "regional-us-central1"
display_name     = "Example Spanner Instance"
num_nodes        = 1
}

resource "google_spanner_database" "example" {
instance = google_spanner_instance.example.name
name     = "example-database"
}

variable "project_id" {
description = "The Google Cloud project ID."
}

variable "credentials_file" {
description = "Path to the Google Cloud service account JSON key file."
}
Customize the name, config, and other parameters as needed for your instance and database.

Initialize and Apply the Configuration:

Run the following Terraform commands to initialize the configuration and apply it to create the Spanner instance and database:

bash

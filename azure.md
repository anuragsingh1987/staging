You can install the Azure CLI using Homebrew on your Mac by following these steps:

Open Terminal on your Mac.

Install Homebrew if you don't already have it by running the following command:bash

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to add the Azure CLI repository to Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap azure/azure-cli 
```

Finally, run the following command to install the Azure CLI:

```bash
brew install azure-cli
```

Wait for the installation process to complete.

After the installation is complete, you can verify that the Azure CLI is installed by running the following command in Terminal:

```bash
az --version
```

This should display the version of the Azure CLI that you just installed.

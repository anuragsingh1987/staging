## What is Jenkins 


Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is used to automate various aspects of software development, including building, testing, and deploying software. It was originally developed as a fork of the Hudson project, and is now maintained by the Jenkins community. Jenkins allows developers to set up continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software. 

This helps to improve the speed and quality of software development, as well as reducing the potential for human error. Jenkins is written in Java and can be installed on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## What is CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment)

* **CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment)**, and it refers to the practice of continuously integrating and delivering software changes to production in an automated and efficient manner.

* **Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of continuously integrating changes made by developers into a central repository and automatically building, testing, and validating the changes. This helps to catch errors and conflicts early in the development process and ensures that the codebase remains stable and consistent.

* **Continuous Delivery (CD)** is the practice of continuously delivering the software changes to a production-like environment for further testing, validation, and verification. This includes automated testing, deployment, and release processes to ensure that the changes are ready to be deployed to production.

* **Continuous Deployment (CD)** takes this one step further by automating the release process to production. This ensures that the changes are deployed to production quickly and with minimal human intervention, reducing the risk of errors and increasing the speed of delivery.

CI/CD enables development teams to deliver software changes to production faster, more reliably, and with higher quality. It also promotes collaboration and communication among team members, as well as providing transparency and visibility into the development process.


## Jekins Workflow 

Jenkins provides a flexible workflow system that allows developers to define and automate complex software delivery pipelines. Here is a high-level overview of the basic workflow steps in Jenkins:

* **Source code management (SCM)** - Jenkins retrieves the source code from a version control system like Git, Subversion, or Mercurial.

* **Build** - Jenkins runs a build script that compiles the source code and generates an executable, library, or other artifact.

* **Test** - Jenkins runs automated tests to validate the quality of the build. This can include unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests.

* **Deploy** - Jenkins deploys the build artifact to a target environment, such as a test or production server.

* **Notify** - Jenkins sends notifications to stakeholders, such as developers, testers, and project managers, to inform them of the build status.

* **Cleanup** - Jenkins removes any temporary files or artifacts generated during the build process.

Jenkins allows you to configure each step in the workflow to meet the specific needs of your software development process. For example, you can define multiple build scripts or tests, or set up conditional steps that only execute if certain criteria are met. The workflow can also be integrated with other tools and services, such as issue tracking systems, code review tools, and cloud platforms.


## Jenkins as CI Tool

Jenkins is widely used as a Continuous Integration (CI) tool because of its ability to automate the build, test, and deployment process of software development. Here are some of the key features of Jenkins as a CI tool:

* **Build Automation:** Jenkins can automatically build software from source code stored in a version control system like Git, Subversion, or Mercurial.

* **Testing: Jenkins** provides a framework for running automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests. It can also integrate with various testing frameworks such as JUnit, Selenium, and TestNG.

* **Continuous Integration:** Jenkins can be configured to run builds and tests automatically whenever new code is committed to the version control system. This ensures that code changes are tested and integrated into the project on a continuous basis.

* **Deployment:** Jenkins can automate the deployment of builds to target environments, such as a staging or production server.

* **Extensibility:** Jenkins provides a wide range of plugins that can be used to extend its functionality, including integration with other tools and services.

By using Jenkins as a CI tool, development teams can improve the speed and quality of their software development process. Jenkins automates many of the repetitive tasks involved in software development, freeing up developers to focus on more valuable activities such as writing code and designing new features.


## Jenkins as CD Tool 

Jenkins is also widely used as a Continuous Delivery (CD) tool because of its ability to automate the entire software delivery process, from building and testing to deployment and release. Here are some of the key features of Jenkins as a CD tool:

* **Pipeline Automation:** Jenkins provides a powerful Pipeline plugin that enables teams to define complex delivery pipelines that automate every stage of the software delivery process, from code changes to production deployment.

* **Deployment Automation:** Jenkins can be configured to automatically deploy builds to various environments, such as staging or production, using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and more.

* **Testing:** Jenkins can run a wide range of automated tests, including unit, integration, and acceptance tests, to ensure that the code changes meet the expected quality standards before deployment.

* **Version Control Integration:** Jenkins integrates with popular version control systems like Git, SVN, and Mercurial, allowing teams to automate their delivery pipelines based on changes made in the version control system.

* **Continuous Feedback:** Jenkins provides real-time feedback on the status of the software delivery process, enabling teams to quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact customers.

By using Jenkins as a CD tool, development teams can significantly reduce the time and effort required to deliver high-quality software to their customers. By automating the entire delivery process, Jenkins enables teams to focus on delivering value to their customers instead of spending time on manual tasks.


## Jenkins Pipelines

A Jenkins pipeline is a feature in Jenkins that allows developers to define a series of steps or tasks that represent a software delivery pipeline. The pipeline is defined as a script in a Jenkinsfile or a pipeline script written in Groovy language that can be versioned along with the source code.

A Jenkins pipeline can be defined as a single pipeline or as a series of stages that represent the different phases of the software delivery process, such as building, testing, deploying, and releasing. Each stage in the pipeline consists of one or more steps, which are individual tasks that need to be completed in order to move on to the next stage.

The pipeline can be triggered automatically by changes in the source code or manually by a user. It can also be configured to automatically run on different environments, such as staging or production, with the help of tools like Docker or Kubernetes.

Jenkins pipelines offer several benefits, such as improved automation, version control, and testing capabilities. They also enable teams to manage complex software delivery processes more effectively and efficiently. With the ability to define, execute, and manage the entire delivery pipeline from a single script, Jenkins pipelines have become an essential tool for continuous integration and continuous delivery.

Here's a sample Jenkins pipeline script that demonstrates how to build, test, and deploy a Node.js application:

```typescript
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Clone the source code from the Git repository
                git 'https://github.com/myusername/myapp.git'
                
                // Install the required dependencies using npm
                sh 'npm install'
                
                // Build the application using npm
                sh 'npm run build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run the automated tests using npm
                sh 'npm run test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            environment {
                // Set the environment variables for the deployment process
                NODE_ENV = 'production'
                SERVER_URL = 'https://myapp.com'
            }
            steps {
                // Deploy the application to a remote server using SSH
                sshagent(['my-ssh-credentials']) {
                    sh 'ssh user@server.com "cd /var/www/myapp && git pull && npm install && pm2 restart myapp"'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

This pipeline consists of three stages:

* **Build**: Clone the source code from a Git repository, install dependencies, and build the application using npm.

* **Test**: Run automated tests using npm.

* **Deploy**: Set environment variables, deploy the application to a remote server using SSH, and restart the application using PM2.

Note that this is just a simple example and the actual pipeline script may vary depending on the application and deployment environment.

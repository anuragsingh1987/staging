## What is Infrastructure as code (IaC) 
Infrastructure as code (IaC) refers to the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (such as servers, networks, and storage) through code and automation, rather than manual processes. This means that infrastructure can be defined, configured, and managed using the same tools and techniques as software development.

IaC is often associated with cloud computing and DevOps practices, as it enables teams to rapidly and consistently deploy and scale infrastructure in response to changing business needs. By using code to define infrastructure, IaC also allows for greater visibility, version control, and reproducibility, making it easier to troubleshoot and maintain infrastructure over time.

Some common tools for implementing IaC include configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef, as well as cloud-specific tools like Terraform and CloudFormation. IaC can be used with both public and private clouds, and can help organizations achieve greater agility, reliability, and cost savings in their IT operations.

## Advantages of Infrastructure as code (IaC)


Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has several advantages, including:

1.  **Automation and Consistency:** IaC allows for the automation of infrastructure deployment and configuration, which helps to ensure consistency and reduces the risk of human error. This means that infrastructure can be deployed more quickly and reliably, with less downtime and fewer manual interventions.
    
2.  **Version Control:** IaC allows infrastructure to be version-controlled and managed like any other codebase. This means that changes to infrastructure can be tracked, reviewed, and rolled back as needed, making it easier to maintain and troubleshoot over time.
    
3.  **Reusability:** IaC templates can be reused across different environments, which helps to save time and reduce the risk of errors. This also makes it easier to create and deploy new environments, as infrastructure can be quickly and easily replicated.
    
4.  **Scalability:** IaC allows for infrastructure to be easily scaled up or down, depending on demand. This means that organizations can quickly respond to changing business needs and scale their infrastructure up or down as needed, without the need for manual intervention.
    
5.  **Cost Savings:** By using IaC to automate infrastructure deployment and configuration, organizations can save time and reduce the need for manual intervention, which can help to reduce costs. Additionally, IaC allows for more efficient use of resources, as infrastructure can be scaled up or down as needed, helping to reduce wastage.
    

Overall, IaC can help organizations achieve greater agility, reliability, and cost savings in their IT operations, making it a valuable tool for modern software development and IT infrastructure management.

## Terraform 

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows developers to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources in a variety of cloud platforms (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc.) as well as on-premises infrastructure. It uses a declarative language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define and manage the infrastructure resources.

Terraform works by using a configuration file to define the desired state of infrastructure resources. The configuration file can be used to define resources such as servers, networks, load balancers, databases, and more. Once the configuration file is created, Terraform can be used to provision and manage the infrastructure resources automatically.

Some key features of Terraform include:

1.  **Resource Graph:** Terraform builds a graph of all the infrastructure resources and their dependencies, which helps to ensure that resources are provisioned in the correct order.
    
2.  **Plan and Apply:** Terraform can create a plan of the changes that will be made to the infrastructure resources before actually applying the changes. This helps to reduce the risk of errors and ensure that infrastructure changes are made safely.
    
3.  **State Management:** Terraform maintains a state file that keeps track of the current state of infrastructure resources. This allows Terraform to manage resources more efficiently and helps to reduce the risk of configuration drift.
    
4.  **Extensibility:** Terraform is highly extensible and can be used with a wide range of cloud platforms and infrastructure providers. It also has a large library of third-party plugins that can be used to extend its functionality.
    

Overall, Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code and can help organizations achieve greater agility, reliability, and cost savings in their IT operations.

## Key Terraform Commands

Here are some of the most commonly used Terraform commands:

1.  `terraform init`: This command initializes the working directory and downloads any necessary plugins and modules.
    
2.  `terraform plan`: This command generates an execution plan that shows the changes that will be made to your infrastructure resources based on your Terraform configuration files.
    
3.  `terraform apply`: This command applies the changes to your infrastructure resources that are defined in your Terraform configuration files.
    
4.  `terraform destroy`: This command destroys all the infrastructure resources that were created by Terraform.
    
5.  `terraform validate`: This command validates your Terraform configuration files to ensure they are syntactically valid and functionally correct.
    
6.  `terraform fmt`: This command formats your Terraform configuration files to ensure they are consistent and easy to read.
    
7.  `terraform state`: This command provides tools for inspecting and managing the Terraform state file, which is used to store information about the current state of your infrastructure resources.
    
8.  `terraform import`: This command imports existing infrastructure resources into Terraform state, allowing you to manage them using Terraform.
    
9.  `terraform output`: This command displays the values of output variables defined in your Terraform configuration files.
    

These are just a few of the many Terraform commands available. For a complete list of commands and their usage, you can refer to the official Terraform documentation.

## Terraform Workflow

<p style="text-align:center;"><img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/terraform-resources/terraform_logo.png"></p?>


Here is a basic workflow for using Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure resources:

1.  **Define infrastructure as code:** Use Terraform to define the desired state of your infrastructure resources using configuration files written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
    
2.  **Initialize the working directory:** Run `terraform init` in your working directory to download any necessary plugins and modules.
    
3.  **Create a plan:** Run `terraform plan` to generate an execution plan that shows the changes that will be made to your infrastructure resources based on your Terraform configuration files.
    
4.  **Review the plan**: Review the execution plan to ensure that it reflects the changes you want to make to your infrastructure resources.
    
5.  **Apply the changes:** Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes to your infrastructure resources that are defined in your Terraform configuration files.
    
6.  **Verify the changes:** Verify that the changes made by Terraform are correct and functioning as expected.
    
7.  **Update the infrastructure as needed:** Modify your Terraform configuration files as needed to update your infrastructure resources.
    
8.  **Destroy infrastructure when no longer needed:** Run `terraform destroy` to destroy all the infrastructure resources that were created by Terraform.
    
9.  **Store state:** Terraform uses a state file to keep track of the current state of your infrastructure resources. It is important to store this file securely and ensure that it is accessible to all members of your team who are working with Terraform.
    

This workflow can be repeated as often as necessary to create, update, and destroy infrastructure resources using Terraform.

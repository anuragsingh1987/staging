**Here is the course link and description -- > <<Link to  be  added>>**

**Kubernetes (also known as "K8s")** is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Kubernetes is designed to provide a platform for deploying and managing containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It automates the processes of container orchestration, such as scheduling containers to run on specific nodes, scaling containers up or down based on demand, and managing container health and availability.

Kubernetes provides a rich set of features for managing containers, including load balancing, service discovery, automatic failover, and rolling updates. It can be used with a variety of container runtimes, including Docker, and can run on any infrastructure, including public clouds, private clouds, and bare-metal servers.

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, and is widely used in production environments to run large-scale, distributed applications.

## Kubernetes Vs Docker Swarm

**Kubernetes and Docker Swarm** are two popular container orchestration platforms that enable the management of containerized applications at scale. While they share some similarities, there are also some significant differences between them.

Here are some key differences between Kubernetes and Docker Swarm:

 - **Architecture:** Kubernetes has a more complex architecture, with multiple components and a more modular design, while Docker Swarm has a simpler architecture with fewer components.

 - **Scaling:** Kubernetes has a more powerful and flexible scaling mechanism than Docker Swarm, allowing for automatic scaling based on resource usage, custom metrics, or user-defined policies.

 - **Networking:** Kubernetes has a more sophisticated networking model, including support for multiple network plugins and advanced networking features such as service discovery and load balancing. Docker Swarm has a simpler networking model that supports only a single network driver.

 - **Storage:** Kubernetes has a more robust storage model, with support for various storage plugins and features such as dynamic provisioning, snapshotting, and cloning. Docker Swarm has a more limited storage model, with support for only a few storage plugins.

 - **Community:** Kubernetes has a larger and more active community than Docker Swarm, with a wider range of third-party tools and integrations.

In summary, Kubernetes is a more powerful and flexible platform, with a more complex architecture and advanced features such as networking and storage. Docker Swarm, on the other hand, is a simpler and more lightweight platform, with a focus on ease of use and simplicity. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of your application and your organization's technical expertise and resources.

## Kubernetes architecture

<p style="text-align:center;"><img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/kubernetes-resources/components-of-kubernetes.svg"></p?>

**Kubernetes architecture** is composed of several components that work together to provide a platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. The main components of the Kubernetes architecture are:

**Control plane:** The control plane is responsible for managing the overall state of the cluster. It includes several components that work together to schedule and manage containers, and to provide services to the cluster.

-   **API server:** The API server is the main management component of the control plane. It provides a RESTful API for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.
-   **etcd:** etcd is a distributed key-value store used to store the configuration data of the cluster, such as the state of nodes and containers.
-   **Controller Manager:** The Controller Manager watches the state of the cluster and ensures that the desired state is maintained.
-   **Scheduler:** The scheduler assigns containers to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.

**Nodes:** Nodes are the worker machines in the Kubernetes cluster that run containers. Each node runs a container runtime, such as Docker or rkt, and the Kubernetes agent, called the kubelet.

-   **Kubelet:** The Kubelet is responsible for managing the containers running on a node and reporting their status to the control plane.
-   **Container runtime:** The container runtime is responsible for running containers on the node.

3.  **Networking:** Networking is a critical component of Kubernetes, as it enables communication between containers and services within the cluster. Kubernetes uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to networking, which allows containers to communicate with each other across the cluster.

-   **Service proxy:** The service proxy is responsible for load balancing traffic between containers and services.
-   **Network plugin:** The network plugin provides networking capabilities to the cluster, such as virtual networks and IP address management.

Overall, the Kubernetes architecture provides a highly scalable and fault-tolerant platform for deploying and managing containerized applications.

## Helm and Helm Charts

Helm is an open-source package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and upgrade applications on Kubernetes. Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications by providing an easy-to-use interface for packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes resources as a single unit, called a chart.

Helm charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, such as deployments, services, and config maps, that can be easily installed and managed using the Helm package manager. Helm charts provide a standardized and repeatable way of deploying applications and services to a Kubernetes cluster.

A Helm chart typically includes the following components:

Chart.yaml: A file that defines the chart's metadata, such as name, version, and description.
values.yaml: A file that defines the default values for the chart's configurable variables.
Templates: A directory that contains Kubernetes manifest templates, which are used to generate Kubernetes resources.
A README.md file: A file that provides documentation for the chart.
Helm charts can be easily customized using the values.yaml file, which allows you to override the default values for the chart's configurable variables. This makes it easy to deploy the same application with different configurations, or to deploy the same application to different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

Helm also provides features such as rollbacks, versioning, and dependency management, making it easy to manage the lifecycle of your applications on Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes on GCP PlayPen

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a fully-managed Kubernetes service called Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). GKE provides a managed environment for deploying and running containerized applications on Kubernetes, allowing developers to focus on building and scaling their applications rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/kubernetes-resources/gke-architecture.svg"></p?>


Here are high level steps to help you understand the process to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on GCP using GKE:

 1. Create a GCP project and enable the Kubernetes Engine API. 
 2. Install the Google Cloud SDK and authenticate with your GCP account. 
 3. Use the gcloud command-line tool to create a GKE cluster, specifying the       number of nodes, machine type, and other options.
 4. Deploy your containerized applications to the GKE cluster using Kubernetes       manifests or Helm charts.
 5. Monitor and manage your cluster using the Kubernetes Dashboard, the gcloud command-line tool, or third-party tools.

GKE provides many benefits over self-hosted Kubernetes clusters, including automatic scaling, automatic upgrades, automatic repair, and integrated logging and monitoring. GKE also integrates with other GCP services, such as Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL, to provide a fully-managed cloud platform for running containerized applications.

## Deploy an application on GCP Playpen with Kubernetes

Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started with Kubernetes on GCP using the gcloud command-line tool:

1. Set up a GCP account / Launch a GCP PlayPen
2. Install the gcloud SDK: The gcloud SDK is the command-line interface for GCP. You can download and install it from the GCP website.

3. Configure the gcloud SDK: Once you have the gcloud SDK installed, you'll need to configure it to use your GCP account and project. To do this, follow these steps:

    a. Open a terminal and run the command gcloud auth login. This will prompt you to log in to your GCP account and authorize the gcloud SDK to access your account.

    b. After you've logged in, run the command gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID], replacing [PROJECT_ID] with the ID of your GCP project.

4. Create a GKE cluster: To create a GKE cluster using gcloud, follow these steps:

    a. Run the command gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME], replacing [CLUSTER_NAME] with the name you want to give your cluster.

    b. You can customize the cluster options by adding flags to the gcloud container clusters create command. For example, you can specify the number of nodes with the --num-nodes flag.

5. Connect to the cluster: Once your cluster is created, you can connect to it using kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool
6. To connect to the cluster, follow these steps:

    a. Run the command gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME], replacing [CLUSTER_NAME] with the name of your cluster.

    b. This command will download the necessary credentials and configuration files for kubectl to access your cluster.

7. Deploy an application: Now that you're connected to the cluster, you can deploy an application to it. To deploy an application, follow these steps:

    a. Create a Kubernetes deployment YAML file for your application. This file should define the containers, volumes, and other resources required by your application.

    b. Apply the deployment YAML file using kubectl apply. This will create a deployment for your application in the cluster.

    c. Expose the deployment as a Kubernetes service using kubectl expose. This will create a load balancer service for your deployment, allowing you to access your application from the internet.

8. Scale your deployment: Once your application is deployed, you can scale it up or down using Kubernetes. To scale your deployment, follow these steps:

    a. Use kubectl get deployments to list your deployments and their current status.

    b. Use kubectl scale deployment to scale your deployment up or down. For example, kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=3 will scale the "my-app" deployment to three replicas.

That's it! You now have a Kubernetes cluster running on GCP, with an application deployed and scaled using Kubernetes and gcloud. From here, you can explore other Kubernetes features and tools, such as Helm charts, Prometheus monitoring, and Istio service mesh.

## Kubernetes on Azure PlayPen

Microsoft Azure provides a managed Kubernetes service called Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters on Azure. AKS provides an enterprise-grade platform for running containerized applications and integrates with other Azure services to provide a complete cloud platform for deploying and managing modern applications.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/kubernetes-resources/aks.svg"></p?>


Here are some high level steps to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on Azure using AKS:

1.  Create an Azure account and create a new resource group to hold the AKS cluster.
2.  Install the Azure CLI and authenticate with your Azure account.
3.  Use the Azure CLI to create an AKS cluster, specifying the number of nodes, machine type, and other options.
4.  Deploy your containerized applications to the AKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
5.  Monitor and manage your cluster using the Kubernetes Dashboard, the Azure CLI, or third-party tools.

AKS provides many benefits over self-hosted Kubernetes clusters, including automatic scaling, automatic upgrades, automatic repair, and integrated logging and monitoring. AKS also integrates with other Azure services, such as Azure Load Balancer, Azure Container Registry, and Azure Monitor, to provide a fully-managed cloud platform for running containerized applications.

Additionally, Azure provides several tools and services for managing Kubernetes clusters, such as Azure Dev Spaces for rapid application development, Azure Arc for managing Kubernetes clusters across multiple environments, and Azure Kubernetes Service Mesh for managing microservices-based applications.
